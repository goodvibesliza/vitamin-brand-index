# Product Recalls & Safety Notices

Supplements fall under the FDA’s rules. When a product is unsafe, contaminated, or mislabeled, it has to be pulled. That process is called a recall.

Most of the time, recalls are voluntary. The brand or manufacturer spots a problem, tells the FDA, and works with retailers to pull the product. In rare cases the FDA can force a recall when a company refuses to act.

## Recall Classes

Every recall gets a class rating:

- **Class I:** Serious risk of injury or death. Example: hidden prescription drug ingredients.  
- **Class II:** Temporary or reversible health effects possible, serious harm unlikely. Example: incorrect potency or low-level contamination.  
- **Class III:** No expected health impact but still breaks FDA rules. Example: label error.  

Knowing the class tells you how urgent it is. Class I means stop immediately. Class III may just mean updated labeling.

### Voluntary Recalls

Not every recall shows up on the FDA’s Class I, II, or III lists. Some brands issue voluntary recalls before the FDA steps in. These still matter because they show how quickly a company responds when something goes wrong. On this site, voluntary recalls are listed simply as a “recall,” without a class, so you can see the full picture of a brand’s history.

## How to Check Recalls

If you want to verify for yourself:

- Search the FDA Enforcement Report by brand, product, or lot number.  
- Check the Safety Alerts & Advisories page on FDA.gov for press releases and notices.  

## Why Brand History Matters

One recall doesn’t tell the whole story. Look at patterns. Frequent Class I or II recalls suggest bigger quality-control issues. A brand that acts fast, communicates clearly, and fixes the problem? That’s accountability. A brand that hides or denies recalls? That’s a red flag.

**The takeaway:** recalls aren’t just about mistakes. They’re about how a company handles mistakes. Transparency beats silence every time.
