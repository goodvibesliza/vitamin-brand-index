When a supplement label lists “proprietary blend” or a single country of origin, it can conceal a web of farms, brokers, and processors spanning multiple continents. Each handoff introduces risk: dilution, contamination, or mishandled storage that can degrade potency before the capsule ever reaches you. Brands that disclose **farm-level or cooperative-level sourcing**, show certificates of analysis for every batch, and commit to shorter supply chains are statistically more likely to deliver the active levels they promise on the label.

Transparent sourcing goes beyond naming a country; it documents *who* grew or harvested the raw material, *how* it was processed, and *what* independent tests verified purity. Look for QR codes that resolve to full batch reports, third-party audit seals (e.g., Rainforest Alliance, FairWild for botanicals), and language about living-wage contracts. Reputable brands also publish contaminated-batch recalls—even if the lot never left the warehouse—demonstrating a culture of accountability.

Red flags include generic phrases like “imported ingredients,” dramatic price drops without explanation, and certificates that only reference *finished* product testing. These signs suggest the company cannot trace lots back to a specific harvest and may be buying on spot markets where adulteration (melamine, heavy metals, or banned pharmaceuticals) is common. As a consumer, favor brands that treat ingredient sourcing as storytelling: granular, verifiable, and always open to scrutiny.
