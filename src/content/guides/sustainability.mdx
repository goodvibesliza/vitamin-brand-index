Supplements don’t come from one field or one farm. They pull from global supply chains: herbs in India, probiotics in Denmark, gelatin from South America. Every step leaves a footprint. The better brands admit it and try to shrink it. They publish lifecycle analyses, run factories on renewable energy, and offset shipping with verified carbon programs. Third-party stamps like **B Corp**, **Climate Neutral**, or **Carbon Trust** help prove it’s real.

## Packaging & Sourcing

The bottle often carries as much carbon cost as the formula inside. Leading brands move from virgin plastic to post-consumer recycled plastic, plant-based resins, or glass with recyclable metal lids. Some even offer refill pouches that curbside programs accept.

On sourcing, serious companies use regenerative farming for herbs, traceable fisheries for omegas, and wage audits for workers. They post supplier codes of conduct and GPS farm data. What they don’t do is hide behind vague claims like “responsibly harvested.”

## Spotting Greenwashing

A green leaf on a label is easy. Real impact is harder. Watch out for empty phrases like “eco-friendly” or “earth-positive,” or one-time donations framed as big achievements. Genuine sustainability shows up in measurable goals...think **“100 percent recyclable packaging by 2026”**, with annual progress reports, setbacks included. Credible brands let outside auditors check their work and publish fines or compliance issues when they happen.

## Why It Matters

Marketing can make any brand look green. Numbers, reports, and certifications show who’s actually doing the work. If a company won’t share the data, the claim probably isn’t worth much.
