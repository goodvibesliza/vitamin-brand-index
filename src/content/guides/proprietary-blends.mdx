summary: "Proprietary blends let supplement companies hide exact ingredient doses—here’s why that matters for efficacy, transparency, and safety."

A proprietary blend is a collection of ingredients listed together on a supplement facts panel with a single combined weight instead of individual doses. Legally, brands must list the components in descending order by weight, but they are not required to reveal how much of each ingredient is inside. The stated purpose is often to protect a “trade secret” formula that competitors could otherwise replicate.

Companies also find proprietary blends useful for marketing. A long list of trendy actives looks impressive on the label, even if some are present only in trace amounts. Blends can reduce manufacturing costs by letting inexpensive fillers “bulk up” a formula while still allowing bold front-of-pack claims—think “with adaptogens, nootropics, and antioxidants” rolled into a single 800 mg blend.

For consumers, the opacity is a downside. Without individual dosages you cannot compare the product to clinical research, verify you are getting an effective amount, or spot potential safety issues like stimulant stacking. People with sensitivities or those taking multiple supplements may struggle to calculate total daily intake of certain compounds. If transparency and evidence-based dosing matter to you, favor brands that fully disclose each ingredient amount or at least provide certificates of analysis to back up their claims.
