summary: "Proprietary blends let supplement companies hide exact ingredient doses.  Here’s why that matters for efficacy, transparency, and safety."

A proprietary blend is when a brand groups several ingredients together on the label under one total weight. You’ll see the list of ingredients, but not the exact amount of each one. Legally, they only have to put them in order by weight. The reason given is to “protect trade secrets.”

Here’s the reality. Proprietary blends are also a marketing tool. A long list of hot ingredients looks impressive even if most are sprinkled in at trace amounts. Blends also cut costs. Cheaper fillers can bulk up the formula while the front of the package shouts “adaptogens, nootropics, antioxidants” in big bold letters.

For you, the problem is simple.

- **Without individual doses you can’t line the product up against clinical research.**
- **You can’t be sure you’re getting an effective amount.**
- **You can’t easily spot risks like stimulant stacking.** 

If you have sensitivities or take multiple supplements, this lack of detail makes it tough to know your true daily intake.

If transparency and evidence-based dosing matter to you, look for brands that disclose exact ingredient amounts or at least provide certificates of analysis. That way you can make decisions based on facts instead of marketing.
