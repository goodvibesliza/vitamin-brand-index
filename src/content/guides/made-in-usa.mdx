### What “Made in USA” Legally Means  
For supplements, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**, not the FDA, sets the bar for unqualified “Made in USA” claims. The FTC’s standard is strict: *all or virtually all* of the product—including ingredients, processing, and packaging—must originate in the United States. Anything less requires the marketer to add a qualifying phrase such as “with imported ingredients” or “packaged in the USA.” Failure to do so can invite hefty penalties and mandatory corrective advertising.

### How the Rule Plays Out in Dietary Supplements  
In practice, very few supplements meet the **all-domestic** threshold. Raw botanical extracts, probiotics, and specialty minerals are often sourced abroad because the agricultural or fermentation infrastructure simply doesn’t exist domestically. Brands that still want to highlight U.S. involvement usually pivot to phrases like **“Manufactured in an FDA-registered facility in the USA.”** That wording tells you the final blending, encapsulation, and bottling happened stateside, but it does **not** guarantee U.S.-grown ingredients.

### Smart Ways Consumers Can Verify the Claim  
1. **Read beyond the front label.** Check the fine print for qualifiers such as “Made in USA of global ingredients.”  
2. **Look up facility registrations.** Legitimate contract manufacturers are listed in the FDA Drug Establishments database, and many post their cGMP certificates online.  
3. **Ask for batch documentation.** Serious brands will share Certificates of Analysis (CoAs) showing ingredient origin and testing results.  
4. **Cross-check recalls.** A product manufactured in the U.S. is still subject to FDA enforcement actions; reviewing past recalls can indicate how rigorously a company follows cGMPs.

Bottom line: a domestic facility can add reassurance, but ingredient traceability and transparent testing matter more than a flag on the bottle. If a brand won’t disclose where its raw materials come from or share third-party test data, the “Made in USA” badge should carry little weight in your buying decision.
