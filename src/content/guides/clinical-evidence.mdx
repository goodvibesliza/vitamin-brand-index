When a supplement boasts “clinically studied” on the front label, the statement may rest on anything from a gold-standard human trial to a cell-culture experiment that never left the lab. First, distinguish **ingredient research** from **finished-product testing**. Ingredient research examines a single nutrient or botanical (e.g., curcumin) often supplied in a standardized powder to researchers. Finished-product trials test the exact capsule or gummy you would buy—same dose, same excipients—so they capture interactions between ingredients and the real-world manufacturing process. While ingredient data can hint at potential benefits, only product-level studies confirm that the formula, delivery system, and dosage reach meaningful blood levels in humans.

Study design matters just as much as subject matter. The evidence hierarchy starts with **systematic reviews and meta-analyses** of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), followed by individual **double-blind RCTs**, then **open-label or pilot studies**, and finally **animal or in-vitro experiments**. The higher up the ladder, the more likely results are to translate into real-world benefits. Look for hallmarks of rigor: adequate sample size, placebo control, preregistered protocols, and peer-reviewed publication. Red flags include unpublished “white papers,” missing control groups, or outcomes that rely solely on self-reported feelings rather than biomarkers.

To evaluate a clinical claim on a supplement label, match the **dosage and extract standardization** used in the cited study to what appears in the facts panel. Verify that the population studied resembles your situation—athletes, older adults, or individuals with specific deficiencies. Finally, check whether the company provides a DOI or journal link; genuine trials are usually proud to be transparent. By applying these filters, you can separate marketing hype from evidence-based health decisions.
