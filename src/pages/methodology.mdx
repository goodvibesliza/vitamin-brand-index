    # Methodology
  </header>

  <section class="stack">
    Researched and compiled by natural-products industry experts. We verify facts against official brand sources, manufacturing disclosures, and recognized certification databases (e.g., USP, NSF, USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project, Informed Choice). If a claim isn't stated by the brand or a credible source, we mark it _Not specified_. No guesswork, no rumors.

    ## How we build pages

    • **Source:** brand websites, labels, and retailer listings that cite the brand's own statements.  
    • **QA:** cross-check against third-party certifications and public filings when relevant.  
    • **Clarity:** we summarize what matters for shoppers: ownership, manufacturing, testing, sourcing, certifications, blends, clinical evidence, sustainability, and recalls/notices.

    ## Updates

    Content is reviewed and updated regularly. Each brand page shows its Last updated date. Send corrections or sources anytime, we'll review and credit verified fixes.

    _More features are coming soon._
